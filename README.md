A little magic 8 ball script

created this little magic 8 ball script i created a file in the ~/usr/local/bin called 'shake' opened it up in a text editor and added quick node command with the location of this repo (wherever you fancy putting it). Now if you type shake in your terminal and enter it will give you a randomized magic 8 ball message. Quick anf nasty, but fun.
